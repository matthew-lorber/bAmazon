# **bAmazon**
[bAmazon](https://matthew-lorber.github.io/bAmazon/) is a project made for the Rutgers Full Stack Web Developer program. The objective was to create a CLI program using Node.js that manipulates a local database using commands in SQL. The app performs rudimentary tasks as follow:

* Take in orders from customers, and deplete stock from inventory, track sales across departments
* Allow a manager to replenish stock and add new products
* Allow a supervisor to add new departments and view summary data

    var selection = view[index];

    if (selection === 'CUSTOMER') {
        const CUSTOMER_MOD = require("./export-customer.js");
        CUSTOMER_MOD.customer();
    }

    if (selection === 'MANAGER') {
        const MANAGER_MOD = require("./export-manager.js");
        MANAGER_MOD.manager();
    }

    if (selection === 'SUPERVISOR') {
        const SUPERVISOR_MOD = require("./export-supervisor.js");
        SUPERVISOR_MOD.supervisor();
    }
